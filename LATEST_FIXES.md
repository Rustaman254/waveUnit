# Latest Fixes - All Issues Resolved ✅

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ RLS Infinite Recursion - FIXED

**Problem:**
```
Error: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"
```

**Root Cause:**
RLS policies were checking `is_admin` from the same table they were protecting, causing infinite recursion.

**Solution Applied:**
- Removed all recursive admin check policies
- Created simple policies that only use `auth.uid()`
- Users can only see/edit their own data
- Admin operations now handled at application layer
- Added service role policy for backend operations

**New RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- Users see only their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users update only their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own data"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Service role has full access (for admin operations)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for service role"
  ON profiles
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - No more recursion errors

---

### 2. ✅ Database Error on Login - FIXED

**Problem:**
```
Database error querying schema
```

**Root Cause:**
- RLS recursion was preventing profile queries
- Policies were too complex and conflicting

**Solution Applied:**
- Simplified all RLS policies
- Removed subqueries that caused deadlocks
- Each table now has clear, simple policies
- Applied same fix pattern to:
  - `profiles` table
  - `investments` table
  - `withdrawals` table
  - `profit_distributions` table

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Login works perfectly

---

### 3. ✅ Wallet Connection Optional - FIXED

**Problem:**
After registration, users were forced to connect wallet before proceeding.

**Solution Applied:**
- Registration now routes directly to KYC page
- Wallet connection moved to optional step
- Users can connect wallet anytime from `/dashboard/wallet`
- No blocking of dashboard access

**New User Flow:**
1. Register → Auto-creates profile
2. Redirected to KYC submission (optional but recommended)
3. Can access dashboard immediately
4. Connect wallet when ready (optional)
5. Invest after KYC approved

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Wallet connection is now optional
